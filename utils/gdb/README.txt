GDB Pretty Printing for LLVM
============================

This script provides basic pretty printing support for common LLVM containers.
The code is partially derived from the libstdc++ pretty printer from
http://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/STLSupport

It has been taken from a port of LLVM on the time-predictable processor Patmos.
See https://github.com/t-crest/patmos-llvm/tree/master/utils/gdb.
