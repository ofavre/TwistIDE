TwistIDE
========

Yet another IDE... but for C/C++ this time!
Yup, a dedicated IDE to this family of languages.
And it's not written in Java so you should have plenty of memory still free...

Why another IDE?
----------------

C/C++ IDEs are not quite well functional.
Their support for the language is often approximate,
and code completion is just a pain.

Why not improving an existing IDE?
There are beautiful libs out there that are particularly well suited for this language family,
that are just waiting to be used. And Java IDEs are just too heavy for anything.

What is TwistIDE made of?
-------------------------

We use LLVM through CLang for the C family language support.
LLDB is used for debugging.
